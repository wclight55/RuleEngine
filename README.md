RuleEngine is a software that processes configuration files include rule, para, token and data.

All those configuration files should be provided by user, and should be added according to the specification below.



## `para.txt`

All strings that satisfy the following regular expression will be recognized as paras.

```c
[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_.]*
```

Different paras should be separated by line breaks.



## `rule.txt`

```bash
[rulename1]:IF LHS THEN RHS
[rulename2]:IF LHS THEN RHS
			...
```

LHS(left hand side) and RHS(right hand side) should be expressions contains paras and keyword defined by RuleEngine.

Different rules should be separated by line breaks.
